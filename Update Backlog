Update Backlog: (in order of importance)

1. Fix the music inconsistent skipping/playing/pausing issue. 
2. Make core "scan" the network when coming online, ensuring that if core was not the first computer started, all devices on the network can still be connected and displayed on dashboard computers.
3. Switch selector computers to use the graphical and search based version present in the original system.
4. Ensure that noisy pocket computers work with current system.
5. Update selector computers to check if they are adjacent to monitors, and if so, display the current queue on them.
6. Add a locking system + permissions system. Most selector computers are level one and have all their current functionality by default, but they can be partially or fully locked via the system control panel. Partially locked allows selector computers to add new songs to the end of the queue, but nothing else (no skipping, looping, etc.). Fully locked makes them only be able to view the queue. However, their are also some new selector computers that retain all permissions regardless of locking state. (they would be located in the core infrastructure room)
7. {any other good updates here}

Far future:
1. Possibly add a region-based system for regional audio playing.
