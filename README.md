## Minecraft Computer Craft Radio
A small, personal repo to host a small set of scripts built for Computer Craft: Retweaked to allow you to play audio from any YouTube video through speakers in-game. 
This is for a Minecraft server I run with some friends, and was never meant to be a high-effort project. As such, almost all of this project is vibe coded.

>NOTICE: This is a modification of [this project](https://github.com/terreng/computercraft-streaming-music) by [terreng](https://github.com/terreng) that aims to add more functionality.
>The server that handles the conversion and streaming from YouTube videos to audio is run by him at his own expense. You can support him [here](https://buymeacoffee.com/exclamatory).

The main addition is to turn the original single-computer system into a network where every computer connected plays the same music, allowing for an interdimensional radio station.
The core system works by having one "radio core" computer get the data from the external server, then transmit it to the radio receivers. The radio selectors allow for selection of music.

There are also some other small features:
- A dashboard to show the connected devices.
- A control panel with a big red button to shut down the entire network.

This is mostly a fun project, and I highly recommend you support the creator of the original system [here](https://buymeacoffee.com/exclamatory).
